# LottoAnnuity

This is just something I have been playing with that was originally supposed to be part of a bigger lottery app that will prob not see production due to an API that is not available.

The app pulls in the current value for Powerball and Megamillions jackpots and splits out what the the payment will be for the annuity value. And you have the option of setting how many people it will be split amongst, in case you are part of a pool.
